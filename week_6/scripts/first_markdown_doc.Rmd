# Introduction 
Today we are going to work with the penguin data to learn *RMarkdown*-

## Load Libraries 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(here)
```


# Inspect the data 

```{r}
glimpse(penguins)
```

# Make a plot
This is plot of penguins of bill length by bill depth. **Species** are in the colors.
Species are:
 - Gentoo
 - Adelie
 - Chinstrap
```{r}
penguins%>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm,
             y = bill_depth_mm,
             color = species))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")+ # here is a linear model
  labs(x = "Bill Length (mm)",
       y = "Bill Depth (mm)")+
  theme_minimal()
```
